Workflows
    - Jobs (steps 1 - 2 - 3)
    - Triggered upon events

Jobs
    - Runners (execution environment)
    - run in parallel or linear
    - can be conditional

steps
    - shell script or action (predefined scripts)
    - can use custom or third party actions
    - Steps executed in order 
    - can be conditional

name: (name of workflow)
on: (key that git looks for triggering event)
jobs:
    (yml works on intendation)
    first-job: 
        runs-on: 


If you need to run multiple shell commands (or multi-line commands, e.g., for readability), 
you can easily do so by adding the pipe symbol (|) as a value after the run: key.

Like this:
    ...
    run: |
        echo "First output"
        echo "Second output"

    steps: 
      - name: Print greeting
        run: echo "Hello World!"
      - name: Print goodbye
        run: echo "Done - bye!"

This will run both commands in one step.
